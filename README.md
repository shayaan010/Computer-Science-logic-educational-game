# Computer-Science-logic-educational-game
In a group of five, we developed a Java-based educational game to teach computer science logic. Users could learn in Training Mode or compete for high scores in High Score Mode, with scores displayed on a leaderboard. The game featured user login for progress tracking and a Developer Mode where developers could modify questions and content.
